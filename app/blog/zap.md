# New Feature: QR Experiences with Zapier Integration! üéâ

We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce **Zapier Integration** with QR Experiences, allowing you to automate and streamline your workflows like never before! With this feature, you can connect your QR experiences to **hundreds of apps** and automate data flows, making your QR code campaigns even more efficient and powerful.

## What's New?

- **Zapier Integration**: Automate your QR code workflows by connecting QR Experiences with over 5,000 apps available on Zapier.
- **Trigger Actions**: Automatically trigger actions in your preferred tools (CRM, email marketing platforms, etc.) based on QR code scans or other interactions.
- **Seamless Data Flow**: Pass QR code data to and from your applications to streamline your business processes.
- **Instant Data Sync**: Sync data between QR code interactions and your apps in real-time, making it easier to track and analyze results.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your QR Experience with Zapier**: Start by linking your QR Experiences account to your Zapier account. Once connected, you can set up automated workflows, known as ‚ÄúZaps,‚Äù to trigger actions in other apps when a QR code is scanned.
2. **Choose Your Trigger Event**: Select a trigger event, such as a QR code scan or a specific link click.
3. **Choose Your Action**: After the trigger event, choose the action you want to automate in your connected app (e.g., add a contact to your CRM, send an email, log data to a Google Sheet, etc.).
